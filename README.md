# 🎯 OpenCV Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of OpenCV-based mini-projects to practice and explore core computer vision techniques like face detection, object tracking, motion detection, and real-time interactions.

## 📌 Projects Overview

### 1. 🧑‍💻 Face Detection (`Face-Detection-main`)
Detects human faces in real-time using Haar Cascades or pre-trained deep learning models. This is a classic computer vision task and is useful for surveillance, emotion detection, and access control systems.

### 2. 🏏 Hand Cricket Game (`Hand_Cricket-main`)
Implements a simple computer vs player hand cricket game using gesture recognition through webcam input. Detects hand gestures to simulate a cricket game experience.

### 3. 🎥 Moving Object Detection (`MovingObjectDetection-main`)
Performs motion detection on video feed using frame differencing and contour detection. Highlights regions where movement occurs, useful for security and monitoring applications.

### 4. 🎯 Multi-Cam Face Tracker (`multi-cam-face-tracker-main`)
Tracks faces across multiple connected camera streams simultaneously using OpenCV. Combines face detection and tracking logic to work in parallel camera feeds.
